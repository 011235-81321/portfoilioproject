    <p>This senior year I plan to take a capstone cybersecurity internship program in my senior year and finish my data analyst certificate. I would also like to continue to learn Spanish and ASL languages respectively. After high school I plan to go to Rose Hulman or Anderson University, focusing on cybersecurity. For Rose Hulman I would get major in Computer Science with a minor in cybersecurity and with Anderson a full major in Cybersecurity. I would also take advantage of Anderson's in-school Cybersecurity jobs. I would also like to look into the Nation Security Agency program they have at Anderson University. I plan to get a job through either an internship through the national security programs out of highschool. If that fails I plan to try and get a connection to work at Eli Lilly. Outside of my main career I plan to continue playing tennis in college and try to join or start a jazz band at the college I go to.</p>
