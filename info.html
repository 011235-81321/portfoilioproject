    <p style = "margin: 20px">My name is <strong>David Lewis</strong>.
        I am an <strong>african american male</strong> who is
        <strong> 17 years old</strong> and a <strong>rising senior</strong> of <strong>Pike High School</strong>.
        Some of my hobbies include playing
        <strong>tennis and music</strong>. I am currently
        a part of my school's varsity tennis team
        and last year I (and my team) played with
        a record of 11-5 as a second singles
        player. I also play in my school's jazz
        band. I play trombone and we play all
        sorts of fun songs over the school
        year.</p>

    <p style = "margin: 20px"> I know a little <strong>spanish</strong> and
        I am currently taking an <strong>ASL Course</strong>
        over the summer. I have
        taken both <strong>software development
        and website database development</strong>
        as classes. In those classes I have
        won the first place awards in the
        <strong>IDEW(Informatics Diversity-Enhanced Workforce)</strong> Competitions in both classes.
        For one I created a proc website
        to help doctors get into contact
        with their patients online and
        with other doctors to make
        information easier and less
        of a physical hassle witch
        was for my website and
        database development class.
        For my software
        development class I created
        a short 2D scroller video
        game where you defeat bosses
        to get the the town and face
        the final boss with lasers
        shields and parry mechanics.</p>

        Outside of school I
        participated in multiple
        programs. Some of witch
        include <strong>BDPA(Black Data Processing
            Associates)</strong>. I go to their
        scheduled classes every
        friday where we are
        taught about different types of code.
        I have been going there for 5 years
        and am in the advanced class. We also
        have an annual meeting witch a select few are invited to
        witch this year and last
        year was hosted at Atlanta, Georgia.
        This is an all expenses paid trip
        where you compete with other
        sections in BDPA in a challenge
        of your choosing. This also gives
        you a chance to see different famous
        well-built black tech companies
        and meet famous people. It is also a
        way to see different companies and
        colleges giving over the summer programs
        that can help you further your career.</p>

    <p style = "margin: 20px">Another program that I have participated
        in is <strong>CLD(center of
        leadership development)</strong>. This was a
        weekly program in which we got together
        and learned about how to be presentable
        and to hold the respected CLD values. On
        top of this CLD is connected with hundreds
        of companies and Colleges, and can
        provide scholarships and business
        opportunities for people who show their
        excellence in their ability to hold
        onto those principles.</p>

    <p style = "margin: 20px">Most of the
        jobs I have taken have either delt
        with a type of sport or tech. My
        first two jobs were caddie at a golf
        course and being a junior tennis
        instructor. The other job I had was with
        <strong>TeenWorks</strong> in which I learned about physical engineering in a
        a hybrid work class environment. And finally my last work experience would be in <strong>Nextech</strong> the program I am
        currently in.
